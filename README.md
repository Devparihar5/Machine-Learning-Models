# Machine-Learning-Models


Intro : As a machine learning engineer, I developed this project to combine multiple machine learning models and train them with different parameters and then test the model trained with other parameters.


#Working

step -1
	: Downlaod all files in one folder
step -2
	: run requirement.txt file in your cmd for all modules that used in this project
	: run command $pip install -r requirement.txt
step -3
	: Now run save_model.py for train and save models into pickle file
step -4
	: Now run test_model.py for test all trained model
step -5
	: Enjoy this project
